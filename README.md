# ReactGuard: Mastering Error Handling

## Overview
This project implements an Error Boundary component in a Next.js application to gracefully handle JavaScript errors that occur during rendering. The solution includes creating an ErrorBoundary class component, integrating it with the application, testing it with an error-prone component, and adding error monitoring with Sentry.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how React Error Boundaries work
- Implement a class component in TypeScript
- Handle runtime errors gracefully in a Next.js application
- Integrate third-party error monitoring services
- Test error handling components effectively

### Key Concepts
1. Error Boundaries: Special React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree
2. Component Lifecycle Methods: Using getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch to handle errors
3. Error Monitoring: Integrating services like Sentry for production error tracking
4. Fallback UI: Providing user-friendly error messages when components fail
5. Error Recovery: Implementing “Try again” functionality for users

### Implementation Summary
1. Created an ErrorBoundary class component with proper TypeScript interfaces
2. Wrapped the main application component with the ErrorBoundary
3. Developed a test component that intentionally throws errors
4. Integrated Sentry for error monitoring and logging
5. Implemented a fallback UI with error recovery option
6. This solution follows React best practices for error handling while demonstrating modern web development techniques with TypeScript and Next.js.
